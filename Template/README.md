# Distributed Travel Reservation App
This app was created as part of the McGill course COMP 512: Distributed Systems. The goal of this project was to develop a coesive multi-client, multi-server system that allows people to make travel reservations. The project is a component-based distributed information system and uses some of the fundamental components and algorithms for distribution, coordination, scalability, and fault-tolerance.
